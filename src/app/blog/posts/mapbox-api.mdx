Google Maps has long been the go-to solution for integrating maps into applications, but Mapbox offers an open, customizable, and flexible alternative with powerful features. As I explored different mapping APIs, I found that Mapbox gives developers greater control over styles, interactivity, and performance. 

## Why Choose Mapbox Over Google Maps?

While Google Maps is a robust and widely supported solution, Mapbox provides several advantages, particularly for developers looking for:
- **Better Customization** – Mapbox allows developers to define their own map styles, overlays, and themes.
- **Lower Costs at Scale** – Google Maps’ pricing model can get expensive for high-traffic apps, while Mapbox offers a more scalable approach.
- **Offline Support** – Mapbox allows offline map usage, which is crucial for applications with unreliable internet access.
- **Open-Source SDKs** – Unlike Google Maps, Mapbox provides open-source SDKs that can be modified to fit specific use cases.

## Integrating Mapbox with FlutterFlow

To integrate Mapbox into a FlutterFlow app, I used the `flutter_map` package, which provides a Leaflet-based mapping solution that works seamlessly with Mapbox. Here’s a FlutterFlow widget that displays a Mapbox map:

<CodeBlock className="my-24"
    compact
    codeInstances={[
        {
            code: `import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';\nimport 'package:latlong2/latlong.dart' as ll;\n\nclass RideMap extends StatefulWidget {\n  const RideMap({\n    super.key,\n    this.width,\n    this.height,\n    this.currentLocation,\n    required this.accessToken,\n    this.startingZoom,\n  });\n\n  final double? width;\n  final double? height;\n  final LatLng? currentLocation;\n  final String accessToken;\n  final double? startingZoom;\n\n  @override\n  State<RideMap> createState() => _RideMapState();\n}\n\nclass _RideMapState extends State<RideMap> {\n  late MapController mapController;\n  final ll.LatLng defaultCenter = ll.LatLng(34.020882, -6.841650);\n\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n    mapController = MapController();\n  }\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    final ll.LatLng center = ll.LatLng(\n            widget.currentLocation!.latitude,\n            widget.currentLocation!.longitude) ??\n        defaultCenter;\n    return Container(\n      width: widget.width,\n      height: widget.height,\n      child: FlutterMap(\n        mapController: mapController,\n        options: MapOptions(\n          initialCenter: center,\n          initialZoom: widget.startingZoom ?? 13.0,\n        ),\n        children: [\n          TileLayer(\n            urlTemplate:\n                "https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/streets-v11/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token={accessToken}",\n            additionalOptions: {\n              'accessToken': widget.accessToken,\n            },\n          ),\n        ],\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}`,
            label: 'RideMap Widget',
            language: 'dart'
        },
    ]}
    copyButton
/>

## How It Works

This widget does the following:
1. **Uses the `flutter_map` package** to integrate a Mapbox map into the app.
2. **Accepts a user’s location** and centers the map accordingly.
3. **Takes an access token** as a required parameter to authenticate Mapbox requests.
4. **Allows zoom customization**, giving flexibility based on user preferences.

## Conclusion

Mapbox is an excellent alternative to Google Maps, especially for developers who need more customization, lower costs at scale, and open-source flexibility. Whether you’re building a rideshare app, a location-based social network, or a logistics platform, Mapbox provides the tools needed to create a seamless mapping experience.

I’m excited to see how more developers leverage Mapbox for their applications, and I’d love to hear how you’ve used it in your projects!
