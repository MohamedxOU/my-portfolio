Understanding graph algorithms can be challenging due to their abstract nature. To make these concepts more intuitive, I developed an interactive visualizer that demonstrates how pathfinding algorithms explore graphs in real-time.

## Why Visualize Graph Algorithms?

Graph algorithms are fundamental in various applications:
- **Navigation systems** (Google Maps, Waze)
- **Network routing** (Internet traffic optimization)
- **Game AI** (NPC pathfinding)
- **Social network analysis** (Friend recommendations)

Visualization provides several benefits:
- **Enhanced Learning** – See algorithms in action.
- **Debugging Aid** – Identify implementation issues visually.
- **Performance Optimization** – Compare algorithm efficiency dynamically.

## Tech Stack

```mermaid

    A[Python] --> B[PyGame]
    A --> C[NetworkX]
    A --> D[Matplotlib]
    B --> E[Visualization Engine]
    C --> F[Graph Operations]
    D --> G[Plotting Support]
```

## Core Features

### 1. Interactive Graph Creation
   - Click to place nodes.
   - Drag to create edges.
   - Adjust edge weights dynamically.

### 2. Algorithm Visualization
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm
   - A* Search
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)

### 3. Real-Time Visual Cues
   - Color-coded node states (visited, frontier, path).
   - Dynamic distance updates.
   - Adjustable animation controls.

## Implementation Highlights

### Dijkstra’s Algorithm Implementation

```python
import heapq
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple

def dijkstra(graph: Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]], start: int) -> Dict[int, int]:
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    heap = [(0, start)]
    visited = set()
    
    while heap:
        current_dist, current_node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        if current_node in visited:
            continue
            
        visited.add(current_node)
        visualize_current_node(current_node)  # Visualization hook
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:
            distance = current_dist + weight
            
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(heap, (distance, neighbor))
                visualize_relaxation(neighbor, distance)  # Visualization hook
                
    return distances
```

### Visualization Engine Using PyGame

```python
import pygame

class GraphVisualizer:
    def __init__(self, width=800, height=600):
        pygame.init()
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()
        
    def draw_node(self, node, color, radius=20):
        pygame.draw.circle(self.screen, color, node.position, radius)
        
    def draw_edge(self, start, end, weight, color):
        pygame.draw.line(self.screen, color, start.position, end.position, 2)
        
    def update_display(self):
        pygame.display.flip()
        self.clock.tick(60)
```
