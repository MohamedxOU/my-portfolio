        I’m a Software Engineering student with a knack for solving problems through code.
        Currently pursuing my diploma, I thrive in both front-end elegance (think React, JavaScript, and clean UIs) 
        and back-end logic (Node.js, APIs, and databases).<br/>
        <br/><br/>When I’m not debugging or studying, you’ll find me experimenting with new frameworks or contributing to open-source projects—because the best way to learn is to build.

<br/><br/><InlineCode>What drives me?</InlineCode><br/>
⚡ Bridging creativity with functionality to build apps that users love.<br/>
⚡ The thrill of turning abstract ideas into scalable, real-world solutions.<br/>
⚡ Collaborating with others to write code that’s as maintainable as it is powerful.<br/>

Let’s connect and create something meaningful!
